2.Open the project:

Simply open index.html in your browser.
Recommended: Use the "Live Server" extension in VS Code for the smoothest experience with canvas rendering.

🎨 Customization
If you want to use this template for your own portfolio:

Edit index.html: Update the text content (Name, About, Experience) and links.
Update Images: Replace My_photo1.jpg and My_photo2.jpg with your own images.
